# Concurrency

Concurrency is a fundamental concept in modern programming, allowing multiple computations to occur simultaneously. Here are some key aspects of concurrency:

1. Threads
   - Lightweight units of execution within a process.

2. Processes
   - Independent units of execution with their own memory space.

3. Synchronization
   - Coordinating access to shared resources (e.g., locks, semaphores).

4. Parallelism
   - Executing multiple tasks simultaneously on multiple processors.

5. Asynchronous Programming
   - Non-blocking code execution and handling of future results.

6. Race Conditions
   - Issues arising from concurrent access to shared resources.

7. Deadlocks
   - Situations where two or more tasks are unable to proceed.

8. Thread Pools
   - Managing and reusing a fixed number of threads for task execution.

9. Concurrent Data Structures
   - Thread-safe collections and data types.

10. Actor Model
    - Concurrent computation model based on actors as universal primitives.

11. Coroutines
    - Cooperative multitasking within a single thread.

12. Futures and Promises
    - Representations of asynchronous computations and their results.
