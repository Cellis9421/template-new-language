# Basics

The basics of programming in any language are the same and serve as the foundation for more complex concepts. 

Here are some of those building blocks:

1. Hello World
   - First program to print "Hello, World!"

2. Variables
   - Containers for storing data values.

3. Data Types
   - Different kinds of data (e.g., integers, floats, booleans).

4. Operators
   - Symbols for performing operations on variables and values.

5. Control Structures
   - Constructs controlling execution flow (e.g., if-else, loops).

6. Functions
   - Reusable code blocks performing specific tasks.

7. Arrays
   - Collections of same-type elements, indexed.

8. Strings
   - Character sequences and their operations.
