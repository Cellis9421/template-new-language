# algorithms

Algorithms are step-by-step procedures for solving problems or performing tasks. Here are some fundamental categories and examples of algorithms:

1. Sorting
   - Algorithms for arranging elements in a specific order (e.g., Quicksort, Mergesort).

2. Searching
   - Techniques for finding specific elements in a dataset (e.g., Binary Search, Linear Search).

3. Graph Algorithms
   - Procedures for working with graph structures (e.g., Dijkstra's, BFS, DFS).

4. Dynamic Programming
   - Method for solving complex problems by breaking them into simpler subproblems.

5. Greedy Algorithms
   - Algorithms that make locally optimal choices at each step.

6. Divide and Conquer
   - Technique of breaking a problem into smaller subproblems.

7. Backtracking
   - Algorithmic technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally.

8. String Matching
   - Algorithms for finding a pattern within a larger string (e.g., KMP, Rabin-Karp).

9. Computational Geometry
   - Algorithms dealing with geometric objects (e.g., Convex Hull, Line Intersection).

10. Bit Manipulation
    - Algorithms using bitwise operations to solve problems efficiently.

11. Randomized Algorithms
    - Algorithms that make random choices during execution.

12. Approximation Algorithms
    - Algorithms finding approximate solutions to optimization problems.
