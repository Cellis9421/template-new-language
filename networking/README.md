Networking involves communication between different devices or systems. Key concepts include:

1. Protocols
   - Rules and standards for network communication (e.g., TCP/IP, HTTP).

2. Sockets
   - Endpoints for sending and receiving data across a network.

3. Client-Server Model
   - Architecture where clients request services from servers.

4. APIs
   - Interfaces for different software systems to communicate.

5. Web Services
   - Methods of communication between devices over the World Wide Web.

6. Security
   - Encryption, authentication, and other measures to protect network communications.

7. DNS
   - System for translating domain names to IP addresses.

8. Load Balancing
   - Distributing network traffic across multiple servers.

9. Firewalls
   - Security systems that monitor and control network traffic.

10. Proxies
    - Intermediary servers that handle requests for clients.

11. WebSockets
    - Protocol for full-duplex communication channels over TCP.

12. Network Programming
    - Writing software that communicates over a network.
