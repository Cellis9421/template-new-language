# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects". Key concepts include:

1. Classes and Objects
   - Blueprints for creating objects and their instances.

2. Encapsulation
   - Bundling of data and methods that operate on that data.

3. Inheritance
   - Mechanism for creating new classes based on existing ones.

4. Polymorphism
   - Ability of objects to take on multiple forms.

5. Abstraction
   - Hiding complex implementation details and showing only essential features.

6. Interfaces
   - Contracts specifying a set of methods an object must implement.

7. Composition
   - Building complex objects from simpler ones.

8. Method Overloading
   - Multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.

9. Method Overriding
   - Redefining a method in a derived class.

10. Access Modifiers
    - Keywords defining the accessibility of classes, methods, and properties.

11. Constructors and Destructors
    - Special methods for initializing and cleaning up objects.

12. Design Patterns
    - Reusable solutions to common problems in software design.
