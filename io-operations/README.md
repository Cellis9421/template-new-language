# I/O Operations

Input/Output (I/O) operations are essential for interacting with external resources. Key concepts include:

1. File I/O
   - Reading from and writing to files.

2. Console I/O
   - Interacting with the command line interface.

3. Network I/O
   - Sending and receiving data over networks.

4. Database I/O
   - Interacting with databases for data storage and retrieval.

5. Serialization
   - Converting objects to a format suitable for storage or transmission.

6. Streams
   - Sequences of data elements made available over time.

7. Buffering
   - Temporarily storing data being transferred to improve performance.

8. Memory-Mapped I/O
   - Mapping file contents directly to memory for faster access.

9. Asynchronous I/O
   - Non-blocking I/O operations for improved performance.

10. Error Handling in I/O
    - Dealing with I/O-related exceptions and errors.

11. File System Operations
    - Interacting with directories, file attributes, and permissions.

12. Standard I/O Streams
    - Working with standard input, output, and error streams.
