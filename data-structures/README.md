# Data Structures

Data structures are fundamental components in programming, used to organize and store data efficiently. Here are some key data structures:

1. Arrays
   - Contiguous memory locations storing elements of the same type.

2. Linked Lists
   - Sequences of nodes, each containing data and a reference to the next node.

3. Stacks
   - Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structures.

4. Queues
   - First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structures.

5. Trees
   - Hierarchical structures with a root node and child nodes.

6. Graphs
   - Collections of nodes (vertices) connected by edges.

7. Hash Tables
   - Data structures that implement an associative array abstract data type.

8. Heaps
   - Specialized tree-based data structures satisfying the heap property.

9. Sets
   - Collections of distinct elements.

10. Tries
    - Tree-like structures for storing and retrieving strings.

11. Bloom Filters
    - Space-efficient probabilistic data structures for set membership queries.

12. Disjoint Sets
    - Data structures for managing a collection of disjoint sets.
