# Functional Programming

Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions. Key concepts include:

1. Pure Functions
   - Functions that always produce the same output for the same input.

2. Immutability
   - Using data structures that cannot be changed after creation.

3. First-Class Functions
   - Treating functions as first-class citizens, allowing them to be passed as arguments.

4. Higher-Order Functions
   - Functions that can take other functions as arguments or return them.

5. Recursion
   - A technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem.

6. Lazy Evaluation
   - Delaying the evaluation of an expression until its value is needed.

7. Closures
   - Functions that capture and remember the environment in which they were created.

8. Function Composition
   - Building complex functions by combining simpler ones.

9. Currying
   - Transforming a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions.

10. Monads
    - Structures for composing computational steps and handling side effects.

11. Pattern Matching
    - Checking a value against a pattern to extract information.

12. Functors and Applicatives
    - Abstractions for applying functions over data structures.
