# Testing

Testing is crucial for ensuring software quality. Key concepts include:

1. Unit Testing
   - Testing individual components or functions in isolation.

2. Integration Testing
   - Testing how different parts of the system work together.

3. Functional Testing
   - Verifying that the software meets specified requirements.

4. Test-Driven Development (TDD)
   - Writing tests before implementing functionality.

5. Mocking and Stubbing
   - Creating fake objects to simulate behavior in tests.

6. Performance Testing
   - Evaluating system performance under various conditions.

7. Security Testing
   - Identifying vulnerabilities and security flaws.

8. Regression Testing
   - Ensuring that new changes don't break existing functionality.

9. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
   - Automating the build, test, and deployment process.

10. Code Coverage
    - Measuring how much of the code is exercised by tests.

11. Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)
    - Describing behavior in a natural language format.

12. Load Testing
    - Testing how systems perform under expected load conditions.
