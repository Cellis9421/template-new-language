# Error Handling

Error handling is crucial for creating robust and reliable software. Here are key concepts in error handling:

1. Exceptions
   - Objects representing errors that occur during program execution.

2. Try-Catch Blocks
   - Structures for catching and handling exceptions.

3. Finally Clause
   - Code that executes regardless of whether an exception occurred.

4. Custom Exceptions
   - User-defined exception classes for specific error scenarios.

5. Exception Propagation
   - How exceptions move up the call stack if not handled.

6. Logging
   - Recording error information for debugging and monitoring.

7. Assertions
   - Debugging aid to check for programmer errors.

8. Error Codes
   - Returning specific values to indicate error conditions.

9. Null Handling
   - Dealing with null or undefined values to prevent errors.

10. Graceful Degradation
    - Maintaining partial functionality when errors occur.

11. Error Recovery
    - Strategies for recovering from error states.

12. Global Error Handling
    - Centralized error management in applications.
